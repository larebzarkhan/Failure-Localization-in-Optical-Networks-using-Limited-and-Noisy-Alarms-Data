# Failure-Localization-in-Optical-Networks-using-Limited-and-Noisy-Alarms-Data

In this work, performance of K Nearest Neighbour (kNN), random forests (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Light Gradient Boosting (LGBoost) has been been compared for alarms classification (i.e., binary classification) and failure localization (multi-class classification) in optical networks.

For data pre-processing, rare label encoding has been used considering the nature of data. Hyperparameter tuning has been performed using Randomized Search CV.

Please feel free to use this code and mold it according to your needs. We'll appreciate if you'll cite our work.
